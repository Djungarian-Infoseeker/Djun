abstract: >
  The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the four major
  professional sportsleagues in the United States and holds substantial economic
  value. Since the creation of the NBA,the issue of NBA player salaries has
  become increasingly relevant and the disproportionate salariesof players has
  emerged as a challenge that obstructs the growth of the league. This paper
  will employdata from 331 NBA players over the 2020-2021 season to develop
  multiple linear regression modelsfor analyzing appropriate player salaries.
  The multiple regression analysis was conducted usingbasic and advanced data of
  players as independent variables, which include dozens of variablessuch as
  player's age, player's number of games, and player's average score, and player
  salary asdependent variable. In order to analyze the results more accurately,
  several types of multiple linearregression models are used in this paper:
  Ordinary least squares, Ridge regression, Lassoregression, Elastic net
  regression. The outcome of the regression model for NBA player salary
  willcontribute to enhancing the commercial worth of the NBA and provide
  constructive input to theleague and the team. This research found investors
  place higher significance on players' three-pointshooting proficiency,
  defensive abilities, and teamwork capacity, which aligns with the current
  playingstyle of the NBA.
