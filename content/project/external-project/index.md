title: The first water lily hybrid I cultivated.
date: 2016-04-27T00:00:00.000Z
summary: In 2022, the hybrid water lily I created produced seeds, and these
  seeds sprouted, grew, and bloomed in 2023. Among them, one plant inherited the
  color from the father and the flower shape from the mother, combining the
  strengths of both varieties.
